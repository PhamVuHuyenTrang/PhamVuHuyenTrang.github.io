Welcome to my homepage! I'm Vu Huyen Trang Pham (Huyen Trang). At present, I am a research resident at [VinAI Research](https://www.vinai.io/) where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/) and Professor [Tan Nguyen](https://tanmnguyen89.github.io/). Before that, I graduated from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/) with a Bachelor's degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.  During my undergraduate study, I was also a research student at [Data Science Lab](http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn/), conducting research under the guidance of Professor [Khoat Than](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/khoattq/) and Dr. [Linh Ngo](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/linhnv/).

## Research Interests
My current research focuses on advancing the mathematical principles that underpin the effectiveness of state-of-the-art machine learning models, particularly Mixture of Experts. To achieve this, I aim to deepen the theoretical understanding and foundational mathematics of MoE architectures and leverage this knowledge to inspire and drive innovations in their applications to areas such as Continual Learning, Visual State Space Models and Large Language Models. Additionally, I strive to develop faster and more efficient optimal transport distances that preserve topological properties while significantly reducing computational costs, which opens up their broader application to a wide range of machine learning challenges that were previously constrained by inefficiency.
